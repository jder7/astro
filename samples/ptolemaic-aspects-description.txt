Major Ptolemaic Aspect Configurations
Below is a catalog of the principal multi-planet aspect patterns formed using only the five Ptolemaic aspects (0°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 180°). For each pattern, we give its name, number of planets, geometric construction, typical aspect orbs, and a basic description of its shape (without interpretation).
• Stellium
Planets involved: 3 or more
Geometry: Three or more planets all tightly clustered (usually within one zodiac sign or 30° span) so that most are in conjunction with each other 1 2 . In effect each pair of planets forms a conjunction aspect.
Orb: The planets are typically within a few degrees of each other (often within ~5–10° each) to count as a continuous cluster. No fixed orb, but the group must lie in roughly the same 30° segment 2 . Construction: A stellium is simply a group of planets all occupying the same sign or house sector. Geometrically it is a tight conjunction-series: every planet is within conjunction orb of the others, forming a bundle of overlapping 0° aspects 1 2 .
• T‐Square
Planets involved: 3 (sometimes more)
Geometry: Two planets in opposition (180° apart) with a third planet square (90°) to each of them
3 . This forms a “T” shape: e.g. planets A and B are opposite, and planet C is 90° from both A and B. Orb: Each square or opposition is typically allowed a standard orb (roughly ±8–10° for squares/ oppositions) and conjunction orb (often larger) if used, but all three aspects should be near exact within normal aspect orbs 4 .
Construction: A T‐Square consists of one pair of planets opposite each other, with a third planet at a right angle to both. In practice: (Planet A opp Planet B) and (Planet C sq Planet A and Planet C sq Planet B) 3 . (The “focal” planet is the one making the two squares.)
• Grand Trine
Planets involved: 3
Geometry: Three planets all mutually 120° apart, forming an equilateral triangle. Each pair of planets is in a trine aspect (120°) 5 .
Orb: Each trine aspect typically has an orb of about ±6–8° (especially ±7°) 4 . All three trines should be near exact to form the triangle.
Construction: The pattern is exactly three trine aspects linking three planets (A–B–C) such that A–B = 120°, B–C = 120°, and C–A = 120° 5 . Geometrically this is an equilateral triangle inscribed in the chart wheel.

• Grand Cross (Grand Square)
Planets involved: 4
Geometry: Four planets at roughly 90° intervals (i.e. two pairs of opposition) so that each planet is square (90°) to two others and opposite (180°) one other 6 . Equivalently, two T‐Squares sharing the “spine” axes.
Orb: Typical orbs are ±8–10° for the oppositions and squares 4 . All four aspects (two oppositions and four squares) should be near exact.
Construction: Label the planets A, B, C, D around the circle: A opp C and B opp D, with A sq B, B sq C, C sq D, and D sq A. In other words, planets occupy four equally spaced points on the wheel (every 90°), making two oppositions and four interlocking squares 6 . This encloses a “cross” or square shape on the chart.
• Grand Sextile (Star of David)
Planets involved: 6 (often presented as two interlaced triangles)
Geometry: Six planets arranged in alternately 60° and 120° separations so that they form two interlocking Grand Trines connected by sextiles 7 . In ideal form, the six planets are evenly spaced at 60° intervals, creating a six-pointed star (hexagram).
Orb: Each of the six sextile aspects typically has an orb ~±5–6°, and the six trines ~±6–8° 4 . All should be nearly exact.
Construction: Two sets of three planets each form equilateral triangles (Grand Trines), and corresponding vertices of the two triangles are 60° apart. Equivalently: planets A–B–C form a trine- trine-trine, and D–E–F form another; plus each vertex of one triangle is sextile to two vertices of the other triangle. This yields 6 trines and 6 sextiles (plus 3 oppositions if fully symmetrical) in a hexagram (“Star of David”) pattern 7 .
• Mystic Rectangle (Rectangle)
Planets involved: 4
Geometry: Two pairs of planets in opposition (A opp C, B opp D) with the oppositions linked by two trines and two sextiles. Specifically: A trine B and A sextile D; C trine D and C sextile B (or vice versa)
8 . The shape is a rectangle inscribed in the wheel.
Orb: Typical orbs for each aspect (trine 6–8°, sextile 5–6°, opposition 8–10°) apply 4 . All four planets are part of exactly 2 oppositions, 2 trines, and 2 sextiles.
Construction: There are four planets A, B, C, D. A is opposite C, and B is opposite D. Additionally, A is sextile to D and trine to B, while C is sextile to B and trine to D 8 . This yields the two oppositions, two sextiles, and two trines that “stitch” the four points into a rectangle. (It’s like a Grand Cross without squares, replaced by a mix of trines and sextiles.)
• Trapeze (Cradle)
Planets involved: 4
Geometry: Four planets in a long chain: A‐B‐C‐D. A‐B, B‐C, and C‐D are all sextiles (60°), and A and D are opposite (180°) 9 . Graphically, this forms a trapezoid or “cradle” shape: three consecutive sextiles capped by an opposition.

Orb: As usual, sextiles ≈±5–6° and oppositions ≈±8–10° 4 . The chain of three sextiles should be close in orb, and the ends roughly opposite.
Construction: Label planets A–D around the circle so that A sextile B, B sextile C, C sextile D, and A opposite D 9 . There are three sextile aspects in a row linking four planets, plus the far ends are in opposition. In effect it’s like an extended T‐Square missing one leg (forming a sort of T with a long “base” of two sextiles in addition to the opposition).
Orb ranges: (General guideline) Ptolemaic aspects often use orbs of about ±6–10°, tighter for fast planets. For example, sextiles ≈±5–6°, trines ≈±7–8°, squares/oppositions ≈±8–10° 4 . In all the above patterns, each constituent aspect must fall within its allowable orb for the figure to count.
Each pattern above is defined purely by geometric relationships among the planetary longitudes (the aspect angles). The descriptions given focus only on that construction (which planets are at 0°, 60°, 90°, 120°, or 180° from each other) and do not delve into interpretive meanings.
